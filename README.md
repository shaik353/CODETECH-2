**Project Description: E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application**

The **E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application** is a robust web app designed to simulate an online store experience. This project covers advanced topics in React, such as 
complex state management, API integration, and advanced component design. Users can browse through a product catalog, add items to their shopping cart, modify quantities, 
and proceed to checkout—all within a dynamic, user-friendly interface.

### Key Features:
1. **Product Listings**: Display a list of products fetched from an API. Each product will have essential details like name, price, description, and image.
2. **Filters and Sorting Options**: Users can filter products by categories (e.g., electronics, clothing) and sort them by price, popularity, or ratings to refine their
3. shopping experience.
4. **Shopping Cart**: Users can add products to the shopping cart, view their cart, and modify the quantity of each item. The cart will update in real-time based on user
5. input.
6. **Cart Management**: Users can remove items from the cart, update quantities, and see a live total price that reflects the changes made.
7. **Checkout Process**: Once the user is ready to purchase, they can proceed to the checkout page, where they will review their order, input shipping information, and
8. confirm their purchase.
9. **Advanced State Management**: The application will use React's `useState` and `useContext` (or `Redux` if desired) to manage global state across different components,
10. ensuring a seamless user experience.
11. **API Integration**: Product data will be fetched from a mock or real external API, showcasing how to integrate backend services with a front-end React application.

### Learning Goals:
- **Complex State Management**: Mastering state management across different components using React's `useState`, `useContext`, or third-party libraries like `Redux`.
- **API Integration**: Learning how to interact with APIs using `fetch` or `axios` to retrieve product data and send user data (like the shopping cart) to a backend.
- **Advanced Component Design**: Breaking down the UI into reusable, modular components (e.g., Product Card, Cart, Checkout, Filters).
- **User Interactivity**: Handling user actions such as adding/removing products from the cart, adjusting quantities, and updating the total price.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learning best practices to manage performance, such as lazy loading products or using React’s memoization techniques for optimized rendering.
- **Form Handling**: Building a smooth checkout process with form validation, shipping address input, and order confirmation.

### Technologies Used:
- **React**: For building a dynamic user interface with reusable components.
- **React Context API / Redux**: For global state management, ensuring that the cart’s state and user actions are accessible throughout the application.
- **Axios / Fetch API**: For fetching product data and interacting with backend APIs.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For styling the application with responsive layouts and a visually appealing design.
- **Local Storage (optional)**: To persist the shopping cart data across page reloads.

### Project Breakdown:
1. **Product Listing Page**: A grid of products with filters and sorting options. Each product card will display an image, title, price, and "Add to Cart" button.
2. **Cart Page**: A page that lists the products added to the cart, showing their name, quantity, individual price, and total price. Users can adjust quantities or remove
3. products.
4. **Checkout Page**: A form where users input shipping details and confirm their order. The order summary will show the total price, taxes, and a confirmation button
5. finalize the purchase.
6. **Navigation and Routing**: Using React Router to manage different pages like Home, Cart, and Checkout, ensuring a smooth transition between views.

### Learning Outcomes:
This project is designed to give developers an understanding of building real-world e-commerce applications. By working on this project, you will gain valuable 
experiencewith advanced React concepts, state management, API integration, and handling complex user interactions. Additionally, this project serves as a solid foundation 
for building scalable and production-ready applications.
